  <h1>About us</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, my name is Gordon and this is a project that involves Terraform, Ansible, Git, and Jenkins to create a fully automated CI/CD deployment of a website.
    It has the potential to automatically redeploy as per a fixed schedule as changes to the website are made.
    All this is done through Jenkins scheduling and job pipelines.<br>
    <strong>Created on:</strong> 11 Jul 2025.<br>
    Im currently working as an <strong>IT consultant at FDM</strong>.
